  CSC C85 - Embedded Systems - Project # 1 - EV3 Robot Localization
  
 This file provides the implementation of all the functionality required for the EV3
 robot localization project. Please read through this file carefully, and note the
 sections where you must implement functionality for your bot. 
 You are allowed to change *any part of this file*, not only the sections marked
 ** TO DO **. You are also allowed to add functions as needed (which must also
 be added to the header file). However, *you must clearly document* where you 
 made changes so your work can be properly evaluated by the TA.

 NOTES on your implementation:

 * It should be free of unreasonable compiler warnings - if you choose to ignore
   a compiler warning, you must have a good reason for doing so and be ready to
   defend your rationale with your TA.
 * It must be free of memory management errors and memory leaks - you are expected
   to develop high wuality, clean code. Test your code extensively with valgrind,
   and make sure its memory management is clean.
 
 In a nutshell, the starter code provides:
 
 * Reading a map from an input image (in .ppm format). The map is bordered with red, 
   must have black streets with yellow intersections, and buildings must be either
   blue, green, or be left white (no building).
   
 * Setting up an array with map information which contains, for each intersection,
   the colours of the buildings around it in ** CLOCKWISE ** order from the top-left.
   
 * Initialization of the EV3 robot (opening a socket and setting up the communication
   between your laptop and your bot)
   
 What you must implement:
 
 * All aspects of robot control:
   - Finding and then following a street
   - Recognizing intersections
   - Scanning building colours around intersections
   - Detecting the map boundary and turning around or going back - the robot must not
     wander outside the map (though of course it's possible parts of the robot will
     leave the map while turning at the boundary)

 * The histogram-based localization algorithm that the robot will use to determine its
   location in the map - this is as discussed in lecture.

 * Basic robot exploration strategy so the robot can scan different intersections in
   a sequence that allows it to achieve reliable localization
   
 * Basic path planning - once the robot has found its location, it must drive toward a 
   user-specified position somewhere in the map.

 --- OPTIONALLY but strongly recommended ---
 
  The starter code provides a skeleton for implementing a sensor calibration routine,
 it is called when the code receives -1  -1 as target coordinates. The goal of this
 function should be to gather informatin about what the sensor reads for different
 colours under the particular map/room illumination/battery level conditions you are
 working on - it's entirely up to you how you want to do this, but note that careful
 calibration would make your work much easier, by allowing your robot to more
 robustly (and with fewer mistakes) interpret the sensor data into colours. 
 
   --> The code will exit after calibration without running localization (no target!)
       SO - your calibration code must *save* the calibration information into a
            file, and you have to add code to main() to read and use this
            calibration data yourselves.
   
 What you need to understand thoroughly in order to complete this project:
 
 * The histogram localization method as discussed in lecture. The general steps of
   probabilistic robot localization.

 * Sensors and signal management - your colour readings will be noisy and unreliable,
   you have to handle this smartly
   
 * Robot control with feedback - your robot does not perform exact motions, you can
   assume there will be error and drift, your code has to handle this.
   
 * The robot control API you will use to get your robot to move, and to acquire 
   sensor data. Please see the API directory and read through the header files and
   attached documentation

 *
 *  TO DO - Implement the main localization loop, this loop will have the robot explore the map, scanning intersections and
 *          updating beliefs in the beliefs array until a single location/direction is determined to be the correct one.
 * 
 *          The beliefs array contains one row per intersection (recall that the number of intersections in the map_image
 *          is given by sx, sy, and that the map[][] array contains the colour indices of buildings around each intersection.
 *          Indexing into the map[][] and beliefs[][] arrays is by raster order, so for an intersection at i,j (with 0<=i<=sx-1
 *          and 0<=j<=sy-1), index=i+(j*sx)
 *  
 *          In the beliefs[][] array, you need to keep track of 4 values per intersection, these correspond to the belief the
 *          robot is at that specific intersection, moving in one of the 4 possible directions as follows:
 * 
 *          beliefs[i][0] <---- belief the robot is at intersection with index i, facing UP
 *          beliefs[i][1] <---- belief the robot is at intersection with index i, facing RIGHT
 *          beliefs[i][2] <---- belief the robot is at intersection with index i, facing DOWN
 *          beliefs[i][3] <---- belief the robot is at intersection with index i, facing LEFT
 * 
 *          Initially, all of these beliefs have uniform, equal probability. Your robot must scan intersections and update
 *          belief values based on agreement between what the robot sensed, and the colours in the map. 
 * 
 *          You have two main tasks these are organized into two major functions:
 * 
 *          robot_localization()    <---- Runs the localization loop until the robot's location is found
 *          go_to_target()          <---- After localization is achieved, takes the bot to the specified map location
 * 
 *          The target location, read from the command line, is left in dest_x, dest_y
 * 
 *          Here in main(), you have to call these two functions as appropriate. But keep in mind that it is always possible
 *          that even if your bot managed to find its location, it can become lost again while driving to the target
 *          location, or it may be the initial localization was wrong and the robot ends up in an unexpected place - 
 *          a very solid implementation should give your robot the ability to determine it's lost and needs to 
 *          run localization again.
 *

   This function takes an input image map array, and two integers that specify the image size.
   It attempts to parse this image into a representation of the map in the image. The size
   and resolution of the map image should not affect the parsing (i.e. you can make your own
   maps without worrying about the exact position of intersections, roads, buildings, etc.).

   However, this function requires:
   
   * White background for the image  [255 255 255]
   * Red borders around the map  [255 0 0]
   * Black roads  [0 0 0]
   * Yellow intersections  [255 255 0]
   * Buildings that are pure green [0 255 0], pure blue [0 0 255], or white [255 255 255]
   (any other colour values are ignored - so you can add markings if you like, those 
    will not affect parsing)

   The image must be a properly formated .ppm image, see readPPMimage below for details of
   the format. The GIMP image editor saves properly formatted .ppm images, as does the
   imagemagick image processing suite.
   
   The map representation is read into the map array, with each row in the array corrsponding
   to one intersection, in raster order, that is, for a map with k intersections along its width:
   
    (row index for the intersection)
    
    0     1     2    3 ......   k-1
    
    k    k+1   k+2  ........    
    
    Each row will then contain the colour values for buildings around the intersection 
    clockwise from top-left, that is
    
    
    top-left               top-right
            
            intersection
    
    bottom-left           bottom-right
    
    So, for the first intersection (at row 0 in the map array)
    map[0][0] <---- colour for the top-left building
    map[0][1] <---- colour for the top-right building
    map[0][2] <---- colour for the bottom-right building
    map[0][3] <---- colour for the bottom-left building
    
    Color values for map locations are defined as follows (this agrees with what the
    EV3 sensor returns in indexed-colour-reading mode):
    
    1 -  Black
    2 -  Blue
    3 -  Green
    4 -  Yellow
    5 -  Red
    6 -  White
    
    If you find a 0, that means you're trying to access an intersection that is not on the
    map! Also note that in practice, because of how the map is defined, you should find
    only Green, Blue, or White around a given intersection.
    
    The map size (the number of intersections along the horizontal and vertical directions) is
    updated and left in the global variables sx and sy.

    Feel free to create your own maps for testing (you'll have to print them to a reasonable
    size to use with your bot).

 // Reads an image from a .ppm file. A .ppm file is a very simple image representation
 // format with a text header followed by the binary RGB data at 24bits per pixel.
 // The header has the following form:
 //
 // P6
 // # One or more comment lines preceded by '#'
 // 340 200
 // 255
 //
 // The first line 'P6' is the .ppm format identifier, this is followed by one or more
 // lines with comments, typically used to inidicate which program generated the
 // .ppm file.
 // After the comments, a line with two integer values specifies the image resolution
 // as number of pixels in x and number of pixels in y.
 // The final line of the header stores the maximum value for pixels in the image,
 // usually 255.
 // After this last header line, binary data stores the RGB values for each pixel
 // in row-major order. Each pixel requires 3 bytes ordered R, G, and B.
 //
 // NOTE: Windows file handling is rather crotchetty. You may have to change the
 //       way this file is accessed if the images are being corrupted on read
 //       on Windows.
